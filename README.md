## What Drives Me

**Driven by Impact.** As a software developer, the most rewarding aspect of my
work is knowing it genuinely helps others. I strive to invest my finite time,
knowledge, and skill to create the greatest possible positive impact for as many
people as I can.

**Clarifying Complexity.** As a mathematician and educator, it excites me to
(re)discover the core why behind the curtain of abstraction. I enjoy turning
these insights into clear explanations that help others feel that same spark of
clarity.
