# Hello there! :wave: I'm Kulla :technologist:

## What Drives Me

**Driven by Impact.** As a software developer, the most rewarding aspect of my
work is knowing it genuinely helps others. I strive to invest my finite time,
knowledge, and skill to create the greatest possible positive impact for as many
people as I can.

**Clarifying Complexity.** As a mathematician and educator, it excites me to
(re)discover the core why behind the curtain of abstraction. I enjoy turning
these insights into clear explanations that help others feel that same spark of
clarity.

## Selected Projects

- [**Serlo Editor**](https://en.serlo.org/editor) — Web-based editor for
  interactive learning materials, designed to help teachers create didactically
  high-quality content with ease. The key challenge is combining a Google
  Docs–like WYSIWYG experience with highly structured, interactive
  exercises—successfully bridging usability and formal structure.Tech:
  TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Yjs, Slate, ProseMirror
- [**The Open Learning Platform serlo.org**](https://de.serlo.org/) — Non-profit
  platform providing free and openly licensed educational resources to enable
  equitable access to high-quality education. I led a team of up to twelve
  engineers and helped rebuild the platform using a modern microservice
  architecture, while also contributing to fundraising and financial
  planning.Tech: TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, Next.js, React, Docker,
  Kubernetes, Terraform
- [**Open Textbook "Mathe für Nicht-Freaks"**](https://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/Mathe_f%C3%BCr_Nicht-Freaks)
  — Open textbook based on the belief that every university student can
  understand mathematics. It emphasizes intuition and motivation over rote
  formalism and reaches a substantial share of first-semester STEM students in
  Germany. A long-term community project and a personal commitment to open
  education.
